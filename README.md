This is the backend API for my social media/blog project codenamed "social". It's very similar to my previous API from my "polly" project except I also used TypeScript here, I'm also experiment with slightly more complicated MongoDB schemes and models.
# What is the structure of the database?
So far there are 2 routes: "auth" for user authentication (account creation and login), and "posts" for the blog posts themselves. And aside from their models I have a session model to handle user login sessions.
There's a lot more planned though, I will probably add more models for post comments and edit the post model to include tags and likes.
# What about the images?
As of right now, I have practically 0 idea on how images are implemented and stored in backend APIs. But when I get to them I'll research the process and implement it in this project.
# What is the goal of the project?
Ultimately, this project is just another step towards becoming a better programmer and web developer. I don't plan on releasing, selling or marketting this project nor do I expect it to blow up or anything like that. Feedback, pull requests, questions...etc are all welcome.
